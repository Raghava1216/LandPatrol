const About = `Illegal occupation of land and houses has become common nowadays. You put lifetime savings into owning a piece of land or a house, and you tell your family members to go and visit the property often, and you all know how frequently and reliably they do it. The sooner you find illegal occupation of your property, it is much easier and less hassle to thwart it. We all know prevention is better than cure. Rain or shine, we will visit your property once a week, take pictures, and post the pictures of the property, any encroachments, general condition of the property in our secure portal link along with GPS tracking information of what day and what time we visited your property. We are only offering patrol service to the properties with a public access road, and we are NOT into real-estate settlements. When you subscribe to our service, all we need is your email, phone number, and property address. We don't need to know your name, address, and relationship to the owner of real estate. We keep all your information confidential and you can only access the updates on your property from our secure portal.`;
